# Material Theme Plugin to Tailwind CSS

Swap Tailwind CSS design system for Material design system but still take advantage of Tailwind CSS utilities and ecosystem.

Primarily this allows you to use [Material color roles](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/roles).

# How it works

This package provides a Tailwind CSS plugin that wraps [material-color-utilites](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material/material-color-utilities) for colors and provides other material theme tokens collected from various sources like [materiarl.io](https://material.io) and the [Figma Material 3 Design Kit (Community)](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460).

# Roadmap

- Support high and medium contrast as seen in theme.json output from Material theme builder
- Implement configuration
