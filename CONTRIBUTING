## Types but not TypeScript

Types have to be defined and are enforced but instead of writing TypeScript files we use plain JavaScript with
JSDoc to use types. This allows us to write safe code without needing an additional compilation step.
Tooling like VS Code picks automatically picks up `jsconfig.json` which is equivalent to `tsconfig.json` and helps you
write type safe code. Meaning the code would still pass `tsc` if it were run.

## Versioning

Versions are controlled using git tags which get picked up by GitHub actions. No need to manually update `package.json`.
